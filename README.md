## CFD techniques to solve problems

To model real life thermal and fluid science problems into simulation and designing perspective cfd is most widely used method. It helps to analys flow pattern of fluid, temperature profile of a system under observation and other important quantities.

Finite volume method is most widely used in cfd compared to finite difference method due to various reasons given below
* 1 It can handle complex geometries
* 2 We don't have to truncate tailor series so no truncation error involved

This is the directory that contains some basic probems and codes which are helpful to kickstart new projects.
